# Expectable

(Work in progress)

Expectable is a lightweight test expectations library for Swift.

Expectations will throw a Failure ([FailureType](https://github.com/endocrimes/FailureType)) when they fail.
These can then be caught by your expectation framework of choice, or easily be wrapped into XCTFails or similar.
